oh, josh! sorry i'm late.

Apparently, people don't get drunk before noon.

- Mmm. - It's boring as shit.

10

But the partners want us there, so...

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,959
Sure.

Anyways, after a year of negotiation,

13
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,559
your divorce is finalised.

14

Don't worry about it. It's only money.

18

It is only

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,620
all of the money.

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,959
But it's the season for giving, right?

21
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,719
I know how you feel.

22
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,919
(YAWNING) Oh, yeah? I didn't know you were divorced.

23
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,839
Oh, God, no. That'd be crushing.

24

- Hmm. - But I get it.

25
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,079
On one level, it must seem like, uh,

26
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,119
I'm signing away a huge chunk of my life

27
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,919
that I'm never getting back.

28

Mmm. Dynamite.

39

Yes, Mum, it is all done. I am divorced.

40
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,599
Well, you should tell Dad

41
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,120
that she is not coming over for Christmas.

42
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,999
Why? Because we're divorced, Mum!

well, without doing that.

47
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,839
No, you can leave the Santa suit in the attic.

48
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,399
Why? Because I'm an adult

49
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,959
and dressing up as Santa Claus would be embarrassing.

50
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,759
Hi. Unless, you know, you're doing it for charity.

51
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,399
Then it's... Then it's, um...

52
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,639
Sorry.

54

That's lucky.

55

Listen. Give me the green light...

- Mmm-hmm. - ...and I'll shut it down.

Did you read my latest memo on appropriate work dress?

Uh, almost done. Don't ruin the end.

76

Well, some people didn't. And those people are Meghan.

Hey, Meghan?

79
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,159
I thought that I have been clear about

80
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,359
the number of buttons that can be unbuttoned on a shirt.

81

offensive.

Well, some people might find your outfit offensive.

88
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,519

I think that's why, you know, Becca fell for me,

110

It feels good to be free.

181
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,359
Yeah.

182
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,919
All right. Thank you for this.

183
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,399
- TRACEY: Hey, J. - Yeah?

184
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,959
I got you for Secret Santa again.

185
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,340
I know. I got you, too.

186
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,639
Oh, sweetie, that is so great! Mummy's so proud of you.

187
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,959
Hey, could you put your daddy back

188
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,119
on the phone for a second?

189
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,839
- Hey, Allison. Is he ready? - You fucking motherfucker!

190
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,759
(SIGHING) If I hear you let your stripper girlfriend

191
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,959
put my children on her motorcycle one more time

192
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,839
I will Gone Girl you so hard!

193
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,599
you can go in. i'll just go in. thank you.

194
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,159
no, no, no. don't try and sell this

195
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,559
as some win-win situation.

196
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,519
This is not my first rodeo, okay?

197
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,959
- Is that Data City? - No.

198
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,119
no.

199
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,839
Rick, do you want this deal or not?

200
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,959
Because if you want him,

201
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,959
you're gonna have to pay for him.

202
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,119
It's almost the playoffs,

203
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,719
not the second week of the regular season.

204
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,580
Perfect. It's the right choice.

205
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,880
I am running a train on this league.

206
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,959
I... I don't think that that means

207
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,519
what you want it to mean.

208
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,519
I'd love to talk to you about the Data City pitch,

209
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,719
for later on this afternoon?

210
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,639
Yes, but first I want your opinion on something.

211
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,959
We've got kind of a crisis.

212
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,999
This is what corporate wants us to give

213
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,959
everyone for Christmas. Just this.

214
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,799
Yeah, can't hand that out.

215
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,119
And I'm already feeling kind of a

216
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,719
fuck you vibe down there,

217
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,079
definitely not Christmas spirit.

218
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,719
I can't argue with you there.

219
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,519
Good. I want to Secret Santa the shit

220
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,560
out of the staff meeting. Come on.

221
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,860
Can we work and walk?

222
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,959
You're not cold without a big coat on?

223
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,799
No, I gain fifteen pounds every winter

224
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,079
so I don't have to wear one.

225
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,719
- Huh. That's a healthy choice. - Not really.

226
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,519
Hey, are you bringing anybody to this wine and cheese thing?

227
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,959
Uh, no, I'll be there solo.

228
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,399
Good. Smart. So you can focus on Tracey, right?

229
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,959
Tracey and I work together. What are you talking about?

230
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,399
I'm just saying. I can't be your work wife forever.

231
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,959
Hey, how fast do you think you'd have to go

232
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,759
- to make that jump? - Uh...

233
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,079
- Boy, I don't know. In a car? - Yeah.

234
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,999
I just never thought about that.

235
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,119
You know, your mind's like a drunk baby.

236
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,319
What do you think, 80 or 90?

237
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,959
What would Vin do? Vin Diesel? Or Tyrese?

238
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,959
(STAMMERS) They'd never make it, right? It's suicide. Unless

239
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,599
you were going 120, you put a bunch of free weights

240
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,119
in the trunk to even it out, you know,

241
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,959
then you just catch air. Boosh!

242
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,199
Fuck you, gravity, and you, Dom Toretto!

243
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,620
(WHISPERS) then...

244
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,959
...just a smooth landing, like a baby's buttocks.

245
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,319
I'd love to pick this up indoors.

246
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,839
You know, I've only ever seen the first film,

247
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,959
so I don't know if I'm much help to you

248
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,319
in this conversation. So...

249
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,159
Are you serious? Why am I just hearing about this?

250
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,559
We've worked together for eight years.

251
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,399
They only get more fast! More furious!

252
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,119
I love this place.

253
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,559
So, what would people want? Would they like... Ooh!

254
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,119
Is this UV? Is UV good or bad? I forget.

255
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,199
not good for the eyes, no.

256
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,399
does it do anything here?

257
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,599
Probably. Is this for

258
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,759
- teeth whitening? - WOMAN: No.

259
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,959
Okay, what about this, right?

260
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,159
Everybody gets stressed at work...

261
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,399
...around this time of year.

262
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,599
huh.

263
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,159
That could get you a sexual harassment suit.

264
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,319
What? Why?

265
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,999
Not everyone likes dildos for Christmas.

266
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,399
This isn't a dildo. It's a body massager.

267
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,799
Yeah, well, it's a circumcised purple penis.

268
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,199
It could be considered sexual.

269
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,399
Why is it like that?

270
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,639
(LAUGHS) Everything here could be considered sexual.

271
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,799
Hey, what about this for Alan from legal?

272
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,319
well, alan's bald.

273
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,919
it's so hard to shop for the bald.

274
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,759
Who are they? What do they want?

275
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,959
Hair.

276
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,079
You know, maybe we should just go get some gift cards.

277
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,759
That's exactly what we should do!

278
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,959
Here's a gift card because I don't know you

279
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,319
and I don't care and I won't get in trouble for it.

280
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,599
You know, when my dad ran this company,

281
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,559
Christmas was actually a big deal.

282
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,919
At the Christmas party every year,

283
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,959
he would dress up like Santa Claus,

284
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,959
get everybody fucked up.

285
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,959
(LAUGHING) Yeah, you could back then.

286
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,959
He would throw gifts into the crowd.

287
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,959
Derek Peterson shattered his femur for a rotisserie set.

288
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,399
And that was before Boston Chicken was, like, a thing.

289
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,759
- I've heard those stories. - He took care of them.

290
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,759
That's what I want for my people. You know?

291
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,080
And I want that drone.

292
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,199
Clay, let me ask you a question.

293
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,560
(DREW LAUGHS) You think that my management style is... Is too careful?

294
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,199
Uh, do you think that I bunt

295
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,119
instead of swing for the fences?

296
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,319
I want to be completely honest with you, Josh.

297
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,759
I wasn't paying attention, so I didn't hear your question.

298
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,639
- I can repeat it. - I'd rather you didn't.

299
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,959
Because I can tell by your face that it's serious.

300
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,839
And I want to tell you seriously,

301
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,119
it's almost Christmas. Relax.

302
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,959
- You want some of this? - I think so.

303
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,319
- I don't think you do. - You sure?

304
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,559
I think you better get moving.

305
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,839
uh-oh. here he goes!

306
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,080
huh?

307
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,559
(CHUCKLES) eat that! eat it, clay!

308
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,120
careful, careful, careful!

309
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,080
(CHUCKLES) 

310
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,780
we're good.

311
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,740
Oh, no!

312
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,020
Oh...

313
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,880
hey!

314
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,280
(GRUNTS) 

315
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,580
Ooh, somebody is getting fired.

316
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,920
(DOOR JARRING) 

317
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,360
Hey, uh, Allison? Right?

318
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,959
- Yeah. - I'm Fred.

319
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,519
I just joined accounting.

320
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,700
(ROCK MUSIC BLASTING OVER HEADPHONES) Hi.

321
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,599
um, so, i saw that photo on your desk.

322
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,799
(KEYBOARD CLACKING) Are those your kids?

323
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,959
- Yep. They're two and four. - Oh.

324
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,079
I'm a single mum. Ugh.

325
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,279
(KNOCKING ON DOOR) That's great.

326
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,799
- I was raised by a single mum. - Really?

327
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,359
Yeah. If you ask me, Tupac was right.

328
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,719
ain't a woman alive

329
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,640
that could take my mama's place.

330
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,980
(BEEPS) 

331
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,359
i don't know that song.

332
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,900
Oh, shit.

333
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,640
Allison.

334
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,599
- Where's Clay? - He's unreachable.

335
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,399
He's participating in a conference... Summit...

336
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,240
Elon Musk, uh,

337
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,960
tech participation... Relay.

338
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,639
Let's try that again.

339
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,079
Allison, where's Clay?

340
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,359
- He's Christmas shopping. - Okay.

341
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,959
I would like all department heads

342
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,599
in the conference room in five minutes.

343
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,759
Tell him to stop looking at me.

344
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,360
look away.

345
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,319
Ooh. No, he's cute. Oh.

346
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,559
Actually...

347
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,919
It's like the calling never stops.

348
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,420
i know. it's so annoying.

349
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,080
ugh! you have got to be shitting me.

350
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,199
So the bartender says,

351
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,959
We don't see many gorillas. And the gorilla says,

352
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,639
Well, at $12 for a martini I can see why not.

353
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,959
You know a lot of gorilla jokes.

354
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,160
- Yeah. - Excuse me.

355
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,380
What's going on? Something's off.

356
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,799
Yeah, everyone's working.

357
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,580
oh, shitster.

358
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,500
(STAMMERING) It's my sister.

359
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,999
There she is! My sister from another mister!

360
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,399
I'm kidding, our mother

361
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,719
didn't start having affairs until the mid-90s.

362
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,959
What are you doing here?

363
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,959
Well, we were just going over your fourth quarter earnings.

364
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,519
And I wondered if I was missing something.

365
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,999
Probably.

366
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,639
Clay, why don't you have a seat?

367
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,340
Uh, no. It's my branch, so I prefer to stand.

368
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,999
Fine.

369
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,999
Allison, would you please remove Clay's chair?

370
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,440
- Uh, sure. - Thank you.

371
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,320
Sorry.

372
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,900
Thank you, Allison.

373
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,079
So we were all a little bit disappointed

374
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,399
not to hit 7% growth in this last quarter.

375
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,959
But 6.5% is right on industry standard for the fall.

376
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,399
Mmm-mmm. You need to hit 12%.

377
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,559
- Twelve? - Twelve is the new seven.

378
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,759
- What? - Since when?

379
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,159
since dad died

380
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,959
and the board made me CEO.

381
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,159
Oh. You mean interim CEO.

382
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,340
Shut up. Listen, essentially, this branch is failing.

383
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,999
6.5% is not failing.

384
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,199
Yes, it is.

385
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,399
We're doing better than Orlando.

386
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,079
I mean, half those jack-offs had mono last year, right?

387
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,960
Well, I closed the Orlando branch. This morning.

388
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,980
(INHALES) 

389
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,420
What?

390
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,759
I am sorry.

391
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,740
Damn it. I hate tension, and I...

392
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,559
I farted.

393
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,719
- Wow. - You are not

394
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,559
selling enough servers.

395
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,399
You have no new ideas and there is no new revenue.

396
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,399
- I have something new. - Really?

397
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,159
- No, you don't. - Yeah, I do.

398
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,919
it's not ready. it is ready.

399
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,719
- It's not ready. - It is ready.

400
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,959
- CAROL: Uh, we can hear you. - Yeah, sorry.

401
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,159
We can. It's a completely silent room.

402
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,700
go ahead.

403
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,279
(DOOR CLOSES) What's the most annoying thing about the Internet?

404
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,959
- Pictures of people's kids. - Linkedln invites.

405
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,319
My girlfriend's always on it. I have a girlfriend.

406
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,999
The lack of Asian male representation in porn.

407
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,319
Grumpy Cat. It's like... It's Garfield.

408
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,639
Oh, you know that orange with the human dick?

409
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,959
Oh, my God, what is this, Shark Tank?

410
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,919
Can you just get to the point, please?

411
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,200
- It's getting on the Internet. - Mmm.

412
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,799
so we can already connect to the internet

413
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,959
through standard electrical lines

414
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,199
and obviously we can do it through the air.

415
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,359
But what if we could combine those technologies?

416
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,319
with zenotek anywair,

417
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,559
you can pull the Internet wirelessly

418
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,559
from anything that's connected to a power grid.

419
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,759
(SOFTLY) Your appliances. Street lights. A light bulb.

420
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,159
You're never out of range, and you're never low on signal.

421
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,940
It's AnywAir.

422
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,959
we're in the future.

423
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,799
And you can deliver that?

424
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,999
I'm still figuring out some coding issues, but yes.

425
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,119
(WHISPERS) Well, how long have you been figuring?

426
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,319
- Four years. - Four years?

427
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,639
All right, well, that doesn't sound very real to me.

428
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,799
Well, if it was real, I wouldn't have to invent it.

429
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,199
i'm sorry,

430
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,199
- what's your name again? - Tracey Hughes.

431
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,399
And if you forget again,

432
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,999
it's on all of the recent patents for Zenotek.

433
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,159
Mmm-hmm.

434
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,639
You know what? I'm gonna sit.

435
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,959
Not because you told me to, but because I

436
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,560
prefer it.

437
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,420
So...

438
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,200
mmm-hmm.

439
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,959
- Is there anything else? - MARY: Actually, yes.

440
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:30,399
This is a sample cheeseboard for our holiday mixer tonight.

441
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,119
I know it's a little heavy on the Gouda...

442
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,839
That was the MVP last year.

443
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,999
Uh, I do have a feisty Cheddar on the bench.

444
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,279
I think that pairs better with

445
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,999
the mulled non-alcoholic wine myself, but what do I know?

446
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,639
Wait, wait. I'm sorry. Excuse me.

447
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,199
You're having a Christmas party tonight?

448
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,639
Oh, it's not a Christmas party!

449
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,559
It's a non-denominational holiday mixer.

450
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,919
More inclusive.

451
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,359
Well, whatever the fuck it is, it's not happening.

452
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,599
Yeah, it's definitely... Well, it's not happenin'

453
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,359
because it happens at 5:30 in the afternoon.

454
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,599
It's just a small thing

455
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,159
that's really important to all of us, but

456
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,599
trust me, it's gonna suck.

457
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,319
No, it's not gonna suck, because it's cancelled.

458
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,599
What?

459
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,599
All branch Christmas parties are cancelled.

460
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,839
It's a waste of money!

461
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,959
Come on. What are you guys not getting?

462
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,999
All right, it's cancelled.

463
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,399
it's not.

464
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,360
Clay! I mean it.

465
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,639
Me, too, Carol. Guys,

466
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,839
(SIGHS) the holiday mixer is cancelled.

467
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,080
yes.

468
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,639
Hey! It's cancelled, Clay!

469
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,959
the thing is not happening at all.

470
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,119
i'm not messing with you.

471
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,839
Hey! Stop doing that!

472
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,559
Hey, idiot, I'm looking right at you.

473
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,959
I saw that! You whispered to the farty cheese lady.

474
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,380
Well...

475
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,959
Don't make me pull rank, Clay.

476
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,279
It is cancelled.

477
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,580
fine!

478
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,000
Then this meeting is cancelled! Huh?

479
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,440
damn it!

480
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,919
I was keeping it light in there.

481
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,079
That was light, huh?

482
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,959
You have to give her a break, Josh. She's hated parties

483
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,159
ever since she started not getting invited to them.

484
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,040
Please. That party's the least of your problems.

485
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,399
Is that Dad?

486
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,359
No, Carol, I just have some random guy's

487
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,959
ashes in my office.

488
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,079
Got it online.

489
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,639
Yes. He wanted them here, with me, at his branch.

490
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,799
I thought they were gonna divide him equally.

491
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,959
It's not my fault that he always liked

492
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,959
hanging out with me more.

493
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,199
I don't care. I got this company.

494
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,799
Moving on.

495
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,919
We have a lot of big cuts to make. Okay?

496
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,900
Obviously, bonuses are cancelled.

497
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,959
You know, there's a lot of people that

498
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,639
are relying on those bonuses.

499
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,959
I suppose you're still getting your bonus, though.

500
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,959
Secondly, I'm laying off 40% of your staff.

501
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,320
forty?

502
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,559
Forty? We have 200 employees. That's like, 60...

503
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,919
- Some... - That's 80. It's 80.

504
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,719
Eighty. That's, like, 80 employees.

505
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,919
Uh, you got to give us

506
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,959
a little bit of time to turn this around.

507
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,919
Fine, then you have until the end of the quarter.

508
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,919
- That's two days. - Is it? Oh, well.

509
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,319
This is unfair.

510
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,599
You wanna talk unfair?

511
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,759
(WHOOSHES) How about Dad skipping my Harvard graduation

512
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,079
to go with you to the X Games?

513
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,719
And you weren't even competing.

514
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,959
You just sponsored some guy's wakeboard.

515
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,300
He got the bronze. Which is brown gold.

516
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,799
All right, so I've made a list of my first round of layoffs.

517
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,959
So you might wanna get a pen

518
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,719
- and start writing these down. - No. Let me see that.

519
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,079
- No. No. - Give me that.

520
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,279
- No! - These are my employees!

521
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,959
guys, are we sure about this?

522
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,359
Say you won't make budget cuts.

523
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,559
I swear to God, Clay!

524
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,719
Here comes the loogie express!

525
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,839
- Don't you dare! - Say, Everybody's

526
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,959
- gonna get a bonus, or else. - You motherfucker.

527
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,959
Suck that back in. You suck that back in! You mother...

528
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,260
clay.

529
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,060
oh, my god!

530
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,839
Why do you do this to yourself?

531
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,759
You know I took nine years of Krav Maga.

532
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,839
Carol, you know, he's turning blue.

533
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,559
Yeah. Our family, you got to tap out.

534
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,580
tap out. tap out.

535
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,620
okay.

536
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,400
(GROANS) all right. you okay?

537
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,159
Dad gave you a free pass your entire life,

538
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,399
and you're not getting one from me.

539
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,999
The only way you're gonna hit your targets this year

540
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,140
is by cutting jobs.

541
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,720
hey, what if we landed

542
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,320
the Data City account?

543
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,559
(VIBRATING) - Data City? Walter Davis? - That's right.

544
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,759
You do know that he's already met with HP,

545
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,959
Cisco and Oracle.

546
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,599
Yeah, but he hasn't heard our pitch.

547
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,780
no.

548
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,159
Josh and I have been drilling into it for weeks.

549
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,079
Yeah. Months. Whole team.

550
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,559
And we have a meeting

551
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,279
- with him this afternoon. - Yeah.

552
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,880
All right.

553
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,519
Well, I'm on a flight to London tonight.

554
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,919
So if by some miracle you guys can close Walter Davis

555
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,959
and his $14 million contract

556
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,199
by the time I land at Heathrow,

557
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,919
the jobs are safe.

558
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,079
Done!

559
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,799
And you'll see, you're gonna look so stupid.

560
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,440
Then we'll finally have something in common.

561
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,920
(TRIMMER WHIRRING) Goddamn it! She's so mean!

562
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,959
(SIGHS) People are saying cuts. What kind of cuts?

563
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,759
oh, nothing's official.

564
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,919
Guys, I can barely afford my rent.

565
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,119
I'm sleeping in a closet.

566
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,279
don't panic.

567
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,399
You can't replace the new guy, right?

568
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,999
You're probably gonna go with people that are older,

569
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,199
- more expensive? - Don't overreact.

570
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,359
I just bought that used Lexus, Josh. I can't give it back.

571
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,959
I put rims on it, man!

572
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,199
I have six parrots with very expensive medical issues.

573
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,399
You know this.

574
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,959
I'm gonna have to put one down.

575
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,959
- Nobody is losing their jobs! - Yeah.

576
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,839
That is a Josh and Clay Christmas promise.

577
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,460
Your promises are dog shit!

578
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,840
- Boy, they turned quick. - Yeah, they sure did.

579
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,740
Jesus. Incest and rape?

580
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,159
I mean, that is dark.

581
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,599
That could be a different Clay.

582
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,839
And Carol.

583
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,399
We got to land this pitch.

584
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,399
okay, everybody knows what we're doing?

585
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,839
Sure. We're just pitching to save our company. No biggie.

586
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,519
And we're proving that my sister doesn't fuck me.

587
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,399
- If anything, I fuck her! - All right.

588
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,159
Yeah, listen, I get the spirit of that, but...

589
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,359
We at Zenotek put the client

590
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,000
in client-server model service distribution.

591
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,799
And this is a leave-behind.

592
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,399
And we have some new innovation

593
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,639
that we can talk to you about later. Later.

594
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,800
You got to... You got to go with us.

595
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,300
Okay.

596
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,319
Thank you for the pitch.

597
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,999
Just give me a beat, and I'll let you know my decision.

598
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,959
Okay. When you say beat, you're talking about an hour

599
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,599
or a day? A full day?

600
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,959
Certainly before the holidays, I'd imagine, right?

601
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,540
Listen, it's Christmas, so, I'll be honest.

602
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,280
Your servers are good.

603
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,080
Dell's servers are good.

604
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,159
- So... - You're gonna go with us.

605
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,959
- I'm gonna go with Dell. - Fuck!

606
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,399
- Why? - Don't.

607
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,759
I... I know your product.

608
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,639
My problem is with your culture.

609
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,719
Our culture is great.

610
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,959
that's not what i hear.

611
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,519
Word is you're closing branches and making layoffs.

612
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,519
- That's not true. - No, that's barely true.

613
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,199
A mixture of fabrication and rumour.

614
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,959
Look, I get it. You got to make money.

615
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,999
And every quarter you got to make more money.

616
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,559
And if you got to fire some people

617
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,759
and cut back on some benefits to make it happen,

618
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,959
(NERF GUN WHIRS) that's what business is now, right?

619
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,119
And as long as the board has gotten its bonus

620
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,599
(EXCLAIMS) and the stock is ticking up? Come on.

621
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,799
Sir, that's not who we are.

622
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,759
(CLATTERING) If you came to our offices, you would see that.

623
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,319
You should come meet our people.

624
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,599
Yeah, we're a family business.

625
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,959
(DECORATIONS CLINKING) everyone loves everyone.

626
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,399
I mean, Clay and his sister,

627
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,959
they're so close it's almost inappropriate.

628
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,660
(EXHALES) 

629
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,639
We would love the opportunity to prove you wrong.

630
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,399
I'm sure you have wonderful cubicles and great carpeting,

631
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,559
(OBJECTS CLATTERING , CROWD GASP) but I've done those tours before.

632
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,959
I'm gonna pass.

633
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,159
Um...

634
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,319
Thank you so much.

635
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,559
Oh, we got that.

636
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,719
Oh, no, they've already put it on my room.

637
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,959
And in addition to the breakfast

638
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,919
(CLATTERING CONTINUES) my company won't pay for anymore.

639
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,880
Good luck, guys.

640
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,279
Great. That was uplifting.

641
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,399
He's saying we suck.

642
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,959
Our big closer was a thumb drive.

643
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,999
Yeah, but we don't suck.

644
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,359
We just need a way to show him that.

645
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,559
How are we gonna do that? We're gonna

646
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,559
invite him to our cancelled wine and cheese night?

647
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,279
No, we should take him out for real.

648
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,399
I mean, you heard him. His company

649
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,959
won't even buy him breakfast.

650
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,279
He's an old school guy who drinks scotch at lunch.

651
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,719
(CROWD MURMURING) We should take him out and show him a great time.

652
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,959
So we'll hook him up with Don Draper,

653
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,919
then go out and get a couple of steaks and an STD.

654
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,959
no, no, no. you're both right.

655
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,959
We show him a great time

656
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,999
at our office Christmas party tonight.

657
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,559
What? I didn't say that.

658
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,999
- It's not the worst idea. - Right?

659
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,199
Of course it is. We don't even have

660
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,359
an office Christmas party.

661
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,119
Carol said no to all discretionary spending.

662
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,959
She wants to lay off 40%. You want to double that?

663
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,759
My sister doesn't do anything at 40%.

664
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,919
She's just cutting off our legs

665
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,959
so we can't run away when she

666
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,559
wants to fucking curb-stomp our face.

667
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,399
This is the way we close Walter.

668
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,559
We throw the best Christmas party he's ever been to.

669
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,839
He loves it, he loves us, he sees we care about people,

670
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,959
he falls in love with our culture,

671
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,199
he wants to work with us.

672
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,399
This is how we save everybody's job!

673
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,359
I like it, Josh. Say yes.

674
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,959
He's walking away, unless you have a better idea.

675
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,759
That's your approval sigh.

676
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,180
Walter?

677
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,519
We have one more pitch for you.

678
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,300
Do you party?

679
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,560
I used to.

680
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,740
(SIGHS) 

681
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,959
Okay, so we have to throw

682
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,079
a massive party from scratch in

683
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,319
five hours.

684
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,199
Yeah. And we got an office full of pissed-off employees.

685
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,319
You guys, I got this. I have a black belt in partying.

686
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,919
That's why I got kicked out of boarding school

687
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,959
and two intensive care units.

688
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,959
Listen. Did you see this? It's F-ing Christmas, B's.

689
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,319
Let's get mother-F-ing drunk.

690
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,999
- Attendance mandatory. - Yeah.

691
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,199
Lawsuit!

692
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,959
Mary, it's for the greater good, okay?

693
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,159
Oh, Joel, would you do me a favour?

694
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,399
Would you get Fred up to Clay's office?

695
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,599
- Oh, yeah, sure. - Thank you.

696
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,959
- Wait! - Yup.

697
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,119
(MIMICS TUPAC) I don't know if it's helpful,

698
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,279
but regarding the music tonight,

699
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,759
I happen to have a friend who's a pretty good D.J.

700
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,199
Great. Bring him.

701
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,119
(BOTH CHUCKLE , ELEVATOR DINGS) - See, we already got a D.J. - Yep.

702
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,959
Um, so let me get this straight.

703
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,519
Now we're having this great party

704
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,639
and we're getting our bonuses at it.

705
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,199
Yes, Jeremy, because you deserve it!

706
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,319
Maybe you shouldn't have promised them bonuses.

707
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,559
No, first rule of business:

708
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,959
Shoot for the moon and you'll land on the sun.

709
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,799
I'd love to know where you read that.

710
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,399
And let's just focus on closing Walter.

711
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,959
You know, Carol burned this place to the ground.

712
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,319
We are planting the seeds of a new dawn.

713
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,159
Smitty? Clay Vanstone.

714
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,359
No, I'm not dead. That was

715
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,719
just a rumour, although well-founded.

716
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,360
How much alcohol can I legally buy from you?

717
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,839
Move out of my way.

718
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,319
I swear to God, I will drop this on your back. Move!

719
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,799
You know what?

720
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,079
Merry Christmas, you sweet motherfucker. Ah!

721
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,199
- You're coming, yeah, Smitty? - Yes.

722
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,519
- Yes! Okay. You want this? - No.

723
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,120
All right.

724
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,640
I'm keeping this lamb.

725
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,959
We need something else,

726
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,959
something that will make us look cool.

727
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,959
Does anybody know anybody who knows the Kanye West?

728
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,959
no.

729
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,959
But my girlfriend does P.R. for the Bulls.

730
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,279
Okay, does your girlfriend have a friend who knows

731
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,999
the man that makes us call him Yeezy?

732
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,319
nate, what's up, man? did you see?

733
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,959
Significant others are welcome at the party. Look at that.

734
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,199
Looks like we're finally gonna meet Becca.

735
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,500
Yeah!

736
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,759
Um, oh, shoot.

737
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,959
Uh, except she's working late tonight. Modelling.

738
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,540
(KELSEY AND MEGHAN CONTINUE INDISTINCTLY) 

739
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,399
Is she shooting the cover

740
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,319
of full of shit magazine?

741
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,639
You know what? She's gonna be there.

742
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,799
You guys! Nate's girlfriend's coming!

743
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,320
shit! match, match, match. match! come on.

744
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,759
Okay. Um, what are we gonna do with these after the party?

745
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,180
Raffle.

746
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,559
For a failing branch, we're surprisingly productive.

747
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,759
Yeah, I just wish Carol could see this.

748
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,119
Uh, no, Clay, that would be very bad.

749
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,559
Yeah, you're right.

750
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,799
All right, go put on your party suits.

751
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,959
- Yeah. - Tonight's gonna be

752
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,800
a great night.

753
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,639
clay, i told you,

754
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,199
I don't need to do any pre-game for...

755
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,119
- Carol. - Pre-game for what?

756
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,959
For the, uh, work session we got tonight.

757
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,799
and to complete...

758
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,079
We're closing Walter Davis, you know?

759
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,599
It's going really, really well.

760
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,119
hmm. phase one's complete.

761
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,519
Why don't you come on in?

762
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,959
I thought you were going to London.

763
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,399
I was on my way to the airport,

764
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,639
but I thought I would stop by and

765
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,620
have a tour of your bachelor pad.

766
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,959
Well, that didn't take long.

767
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,759
How did you know about my divorce?

768
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,639
Oh, you changed your emergency contact to self.

769
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,839
And nobody single by choice

770
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,119
would live this close to the freeway.

771
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,959
Is that robe why your wife left you?

772
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,199
What do you want, Carol?

773
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,959
I want you to work for me in New York.

774
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,079
You basically run this branch without the credit.

775
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,839
I will double your salary, you'll get job security,

776
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,799
and a boss who doesn't end every memo

777
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,519
with a quote from Aerosmith.

778
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,319
I could never do that to Clay, and I'm very happy where I am.

779
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,519
- Really? - Yeah.

780
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,600
I don't see happy.

781
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,480
I see crappy. And a rug that makes me sad.

782
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,580
Anyway, um...

783
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,799
I don't know,

784
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,959
just think about it. When the branch closes,

785
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,319
and Clay has a trust fund to fall back on,

786
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,559
what are you gonna have?

787
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,100
Not much.

788
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,280
merry christmas!

789
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,120
(ALL MURMUR) 

790
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,120
- Thank you. - You got it.

791
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,279
Hey, man. Good to see you. Hi.

792
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,399
Eight years

793
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,839
- I've been working here. - Turn around.

794
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,959
What are you hoping to find anyway, Carla?

795
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,319
What's your dream contraband?

796
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,959
I just like making you my bitch.

797
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,279
you can go. thank you.

798
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,959
- CARLA: Josh. - Wow! You look like

799
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,000
Cinderella, if she joined the TSA.

800
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,959
(LAUGHING) Very, very nice. Okay, take a look at this, please.

801
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,159
Ooh, who's Mr December?

802
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,719
This is Walter Davis, he's a VIP.

803
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,199
I want you to do me a favour and let me know the second

804
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,599
he comes in. Can you do that?

805
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,159
You will hear the sound of heavy flirting.

806
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,199
Or just a text. That'd be great.

807
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,639
And are you gonna join us later?

808
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,119
(FARTING) No, I doubt it. I have to protect the front lines,

809
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,759
make sure no crazy stuff happens.

810
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,999
but if it does... i'm ready.

811
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,839
And you went with the yellow. Smart.

812
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,199
right?

813
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,440
hey.

814
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,159
- How's everyone doing tonight? - Great.

815
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,079
- It's my birthday. - Ah.

816
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,940
Really committing. That's nice.

817
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,680
Hey, look at that!

818
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,639
- Hi. - Hey, there, Susan.

819
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,359
- Nice reindeer, right? - How you doin'?

820
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,639
Throw that in coat check for me please.

821
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,719
Thank you. You look great. Oh.

822
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,079
- Hey, Josh. - Hey, Dean.

823
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,079
You... You thought you'd bring the kid, huh?

824
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,519
Yeah. We couldn't get anyone to watch him.

825
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,159
But don't worry, he has an iPad.

826
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,700
(WHISPERS , WHISPERS) We could axe murder each other and he wouldn't even notice.

827
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,919
Yeah, that's the one.

828
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,959
Okay. Well, can you stick him in my office for me?

829
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,759
- If you're cool with that. - Sure. Well, not cool, but...

830
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,599
- Have a good time. - Thank you.

831
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,199
(STAMMERS) All right. Let's drop him quick,

832
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,260
because these edibles are gonna kick in any second.

833
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,560
- Hey, Mr Parker. - Hey, Rodney.

834
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,959
- Foam finger? - Uh-uh, neither.

835
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,839
And, you know, we can skip this, too.

836
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,940
- Good spirit, though. Yep. - Okay.

837
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,639
Could I have a beer, please? Pretty great, huh, Jeremy?

838
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,559
Yeah, it's so weird, I feel like I'm still at the office.

839
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,760
Yeah. Oh. Thank you.

840
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,140
(CHIMING) 

841
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,200
God,

842
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,839
I know I haven't asked You for much in this life.

843
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,959
Granted, I was born rich.

844
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,000
And white. And male. And straight.

845
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,220
Except for that one time. But that's Las Vegas.

846
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,319
But tonight I need You to bless this party.

847
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,399
This party has to rock.

848
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,959
So we can get Walter's contract,

849
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,959
(PERSON CLAPPING) so that everyone can keep their jobs,

850
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,639
especially Allison. I mean, she is losing it!

851
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,959
And she has all my personal information.

852
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,159
And so that we can prove my sister wrong.

853
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,020
Show her that I am a good boss.

854
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,559
And will You say hi to our dad?

855
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,480
And tell him we really miss him.

856
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,639
And that I'm rocking his Santa suit.

857
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,519
oh, and tell prince and david bowie

858
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,959
how much they meant to everybody.

859
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,999
I mean, Labyrinth, Purple Rain...

860
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,600
They know.

861
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,919
All right,

862
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,840
(CHUCKLES) let's light this fucking candle.

863
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,500
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, Zenotek!

864
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,959
It's me, Santa Claus!

865
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,540
I'ma comin' to town for an epic night. Yay!

866
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,160
Santa!

867
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,100
That's okay, we'll get there.

868
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,980
Watch this, Greg.

869
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,380
Dean! Clear. I'm coming around.

870
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,060
Oh, shit.

871
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,639
Oh, God.

872
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,240
it's okay!

873
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,199
It's okay! That was part of it.

874
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,959
okay, santa, what an entrance!

875
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,719
Oh! Right down the chimney, folks!

876
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,839
Merry Christmas, bitches! Santa can't be hurt.

877
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,999
You doing okay? You all right?

878
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,559
- That really did hurt, yeah... - Are you sure?

879
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,559
But you know what, I had this for padding.

880
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,519
Holy shit. What the fuck is that?

881
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,959
Tell me that's not for something illegal.

882
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,319
No, no, no. Don't worry, this is all mine.

883
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,999
I rented one of those Money Tornados.

884
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,559
So for the bonuses later,

885
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,119
I'm gonna make it rain like a hurricane.

886
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,639
Are you sure you're not getting carried away?

887
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,319
This seems like a lot of money you're spending.

888
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,119
Josh, this is Christmas, okay?

889
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,959
And if anybody knows how to work within a budget, it's me.

890
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,079
All right? And speaking of.

891
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,959
There you go. Hi.

892
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,959
- Cool. - Little Jesus.

893
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,199
- Did you rent a live baby? - Yeah, for the nativity scene.

894
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,119
What? It's cheaper than you think, okay?

895
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,480
Is it?

896
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,839
Oh, shit! DJ Calvis in the house tonight!

897
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,560
Oh, God, no.

898
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,240
dj calvis.

899
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,500
(CHUCKLES) Joel's friend looks just like Joel.

900
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,359
Ooh! Looks like some babies getting made tonight!

901
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,959
I'm not looking to get pregnant tonight.

902
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,079
Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry.

903
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,279
Joel, that's a red card for you.

904
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,319
Um, babies are not getting made tonight,

905
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,959
not here on company property.

906
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,559
If you're going to have intercourse,

907
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,319
please go beyond the flood lamps

908
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,919
at the perimeter of the plaza

909
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,279
and into the Rite Aid parking lot.

910
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,959
That's right. 'Cause we fucking tonight!

911
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,839
(MOUTHS) joel. language.

912
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,199
This is still an office, and

913
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,999
even though it's dark outside, the rules don't turn off.

914
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,959
The rules may not turn off, but your inhibitions can!

915
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,519
I'm talking about take your pee-pees out

916
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,200
(MOUTHING) and put 'em in some booties!

917
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,279
And remember that tonight the decisions you make

918
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,279
will have consequences that will haunt you

919
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,719
(MOUTHING) for the rest of your professional lives.

920
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,320
And, um...

921
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,799
Yeah, Mary, way to psyche everybody up!

922
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,559
if you're gonna fuck,

923
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,799
do it in the parking lot.

924
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,460
turn it up!

925
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,940
hey. hey! someone cleans up nice.

926
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,959
Oh...

927
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,359
(SIGHS) Yeah, I... I'm wearing the same clothes, from earlier.

928
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,799
Oh, yeah. I was just making a party joke.

929
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,639
I didn't want to go all the way home

930
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,519
and then come back, so I just sat in my car and worked.

931
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,959
Oh, also I was waiting for my phone to charge.

932
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,700
oh. so you're all charged up!

933
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,500
(BREATHING HEAVILY) What?

934
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,959
I said you're all charged up.

935
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,839
Yeah, my phone.

936
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,399
Hey, the music is really loud.

937
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,319
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?

938
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,460
- Uh, yeah. - Okay.

939
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,279
This is Zenotek.

940
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,820
Oh, shit!

941
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,959
That's Jimmy Butler right there!

942
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,559
Who's Jimmy Butler?

943
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,759
Two-time All-Star. Best player on my fantasy team.

944
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,780
fuck you, butler!

945
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,399
These are great. You know what?

946
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,919
Why don't you give me your number

947
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,319
and I'll text these to you.

948
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,959
Excuse me. Hey. Hi.

949
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,959
- Jimmy, hey, this is Josh. - Hey. How you doing?

950
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,839
So you the big man around here, huh?

951
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,959
I'm not that big, no. I'm feeling small right now.

952
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,959
Look at this. Good for you.

953
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,319
Here's the big man!

954
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,719
Jimmy Buckets. Clay Vanstone.

955
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,639
Thanks for coming to our Christmas party, man.

956
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,959
Of course. I've been trying to expand

957
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,279
the Jimmy Butler empire

958
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,559
into the tech space.

959
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,959
I'm thinking Jimmy Butler dating app.

960
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,999
- Maybe Butlerbook? - I like it.

961
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,079
- Jimmyface? - These are all good ideas.

962
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,199
Do you want to see the first processor that we ever made?

963
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,799
It's as big as a mini-fridge and it used to set fires.

964
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,999
It's upstairs with the good tequila.

965
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,159
- Of course. - Casamigos.

966
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,559
i'll save some for you.

967
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,959
Geek yourself out! He's really into technology.

968
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,799
Will you remind me, how do you know

969
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,959
Jimmy Butler again?

970
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,279
Remember, I told you my friend does P.R. for the Bulls?

971
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,540
- Yes! Yeah. - Right.

972
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,719
I thought that bringing a famous basketball player

973
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,959
would help with Walter.

974
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,959
- Ah. - You're cool with that, right?

975
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,079
Why wouldn't I be cool?

976
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,199
(EXCLAIMS) It's the greatest idea in the world.

977
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,399
Of course I'm cool.

978
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,959
- Very cool. Please. - Okay.

979
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,959
Yeah. Mr Cool. I graduated valedictorian

980
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,959
from Cool University!

981
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,740
Good old C.U.

982
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,240
Mmm-hmm.

983
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,919
Okay.

984
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,580
C.U. later!

985
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,620
Oh, Josh.

986
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,999
Savannah?

987
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,119
I think you mean Becca, right?

988
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,420
uh...

989
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,319
I'm gonna be honest, I've never done this before.

990
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,959
Although my mum and I have watched

991
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,559
Pretty Woman, like, a million times.

992
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,380
Oh, I love that movie! It's why I'm doing this.

993
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,640
- Oh, wow. - Yeah.

994
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,639
it feels kind of dirty.

995
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,959
You feel dirty?

996
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,559
(CAROL SCOFFS) You're my third client tonight. It's only 9:00 PM.

997
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,959
Oh, really?

998
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,199
So, um, you just have to pay my manager,

999
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,959
and then we're, like, good.

1000
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,860
Oh, yeah, um...

1001
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,399
Got it right here.

1002
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,940
Hi. Nate.

1003
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,280
(CAROL GRUNTS) 

1004
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,319
- Nate? - Yeah.

1005
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,959
hi, i'm trina.

1006
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,720
I don't do handshakes, I do hugs. Get in here!

1007
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,639
Oh, my gosh, you guys are gonna have

1008
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,559
so much fun tonight. I can feel it.

1009
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,959
- You're already a couple. - Hope so.

1010
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,959
already.

1011
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,799
- Is this for me? - Um, yes, ma'am.

1012
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,959
Oh, my gosh. Look at him. Prepared. I love that.

1013
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,959
(BOTH GRUNTING) I'm not even gonna count it.

1014
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,319
- You know why? - Mmm-mmm.

1015
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,519
- 'Cause we're friends, right? - Yeah.

1016
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,399
yeah, we're not fucking friends.

1017
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,719
(GRUNTING) Oh, my God.

1018
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,839
So if you're thinking of fucking with me,

1019
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,559
or with my girl,

1020
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,959
don't. Because I'm hella stressed out right now.

1021
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,559
This week has been a scheduling nightmare!

1022
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,839
My iCal crashed,

1023
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,839
and now all my appointments are set in 2019.

1024
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,999
And in Hebrew.

1025
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,399
It's a flawed program. I've been saying this for years.

1026
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,880
(COUGHING) shut up.

1027
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,840
My point is,

1028
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,279
if one more person pisses me off... One more...

1029
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,079
(PANTING) I don't know what's gonna happen.

1030
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,119
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1031
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,840
(COUGHING) we're clear?

1032
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,399
Okay, so now, um, just have a good time.

1033
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,719
If you use handcuffs, have a spare key, okay?

1034
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,839
Jesus, we do not want to go through Thanksgiving again.

1035
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,559
Um, hey, if you need me in the next hour,

1036
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,759
I'll be at Whole Foods.

1037
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,060
Okay.

1038
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,399
Alexei, open my fucking door!

1039
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,119
Come on. Let's go meet your friends.

1040
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,159
I can close it myself!

1041
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,780
I'm a woman in 2016. Jesus.

1042
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,220
(PANTING) 

1043
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,839
Okay, Clay, incoming. I just got a text from Carla.

1044
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,079
Walter's on his way up. This is it.

1045
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,319
Okay, okay. So we need an employee

1046
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,599
(SCOFFS) to sit on my lap right when he comes up.

1047
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,959
A cheerful one. Definitely not Jeremy.

1048
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,199
Uh, sure, great plan.

1049
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,140
Great. Good, good. Here. You try and get this on.

1050
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,999
hey, walter!

1051
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,639
- Welcome to Zenotek. - How are you?

1052
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,959
I'm so glad you came.

1053
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,079
Good to see you. Can I take your coat?

1054
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,919
- No, no, I'm good, actually. - You sure? Okay.

1055
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,959
All right. Walt, what would you like to get started with?

1056
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,959
(PANTING) You know, we got a photo booth.

1057
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,359
It's like getting your picture taken in a tiny house.

1058
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,279
Oh, uh, Jimmy Butler is here!

1059
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,319
Jimmy Butler from the Bulls is here.

1060
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,599
What? Come on! Where is he?

1061
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,959
Do you want to take a selfie with him? Everyone's doin' it.

1062
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,719
You know, I'm a Cavs fan, actually.

1063
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,079
- Oh. - There's a good team.

1064
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,719
- This was a mistake. - Hang on. Hang on.

1065
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,959
No, no, no. Come on.

1066
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,119
Now, a mistake would be to miss the salmon station.

1067
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,519
Do you like salmon? Huh?

1068
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,959
You want to swim upstream with me and go try some salmon?

1069
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,919
What does that even mean?

1070
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,839
You know what? Let's start with a drink. Come on.

1071
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,639
Yeah. Are you thirsty? Clay, you want a drink with Walter?

1072
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,900
One vibrator, please.

1073
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,799
okay. here you go.

1074
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,599
- It's really a body massager. - No, it's a vibrator.

1075
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,200
hey, josh!

1076
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,799
Oh, hey, Jeremy. This is Jeremy,

1077
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,279
our customer service manager.

1078
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,919
Hi, nice to meet you. Mary just fucking cited me!

1079
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,519
Okay? I thought this was a party.

1080
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,959
If I want to dick tap Alan, I'm gonna dick tap Alan.

1081
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,119
That's a timeless gag!

1082
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,079
- Never not funny! - Okay, off you go.

1083
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:09,080
She is like a poisonous fucking cloud of shit gas,

1084
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,519
like, just seeping into everybody's good time.

1085
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,719
Every word she says makes my fucking haemorrhoids throb!

1086
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,359
- I want that on the record. - It is.

1087
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,839
He's in customer service?

1088
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,999
Yeah, he's much better on the phone.

1089
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,959
That's really where he shines. Here we go.

1090
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,319
(STAMMERS) Hey, can we get a scotch? Um, Macallan, right?

1091
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,639
Uh, no, dude. It's the eggnog luge.

1092
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,759
Oh. Just the eggnog. Okay. Great. Well...

1093
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,639
Uh, looks like fun. Ladies first.

1094
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,759
- Josh, I insist. After you. - Well, I'm not much on eggnog.

1095
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,999
don't listen to this guy. he's mr fun.

1096
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,559
He'll do anything for the party. So, come on!

1097
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,319
Hey, everybody! Josh is gonna do the luge!

1098
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,559
No, no. I don't think so. It's not for me.

1099
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,940
josh! josh! josh! josh!

1100
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,559
It looks like they want you to do it.

1101
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,559
Should I do it? I'll do it.

1102
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,159
I'll do it, I'll do it. Okay, let's do it.

1103
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,959
This the luge right here? Here we go.

1104
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,580
Here we go... Here we go...

1105
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,880
mmm-hmm.

1106
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,040
Mmm.

1107
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,440
Oh, God.

1108
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,079
Whoo! Okay, Walter, your turn.

1109
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,279
Where'd Walter go?

1110
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,959
I totally got you deep throating him.

1111
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,359
Oh, well, look at that. That's beautiful.

1112
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,919
Where'd Walter go, huh? Clay, did you see Walter?

1113
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,519
I don't know about that whole throne thing.

1114
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,799
I mean, nobody liked the gifts,

1115
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,999
everybody was complaining and the lap-sitting got weird.

1116
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,199
Oh, no.

1117
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,359
what's happening?

1118
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,559
well, it's just not working.

1119
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,719
If you took away everybody's drinks

1120
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,919
and turned up the lights,

1121
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,839
it just looks like we're at work. You know what I mean?

1122
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,959
We need to get amped up.

1123
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,959
We need to get them interacting.

1124
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,759
You guys should do what you did at the party last year.

1125
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,119
No. Not doing that. Come on.

1126
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,399
No, that was lame.

1127
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,199
No, no, it was fucking awesome! People loved it!

1128
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,639
It wasn't. And they didn't.

1129
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,199
Do it for the company. All right?

1130
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,999
I'm gonna go give Walter party mouth-to-mouth.

1131
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,780
Is he crying?

1132
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,999
I wanted to give you this pamphlet

1133
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,599
which has a lot of good information

1134
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,359
about the signs and symptoms of sadness.

1135
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,599
When I'm sad,

1136
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,780
I like to remember something my grandma used to sing.

1137
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,220
It's about ducklings.

1138
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,199
Mary, you wore a blue coat, right?

1139
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,999
- No, I wore my beige poof. - Oh, that's it.

1140
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,199
It's probably not a big deal,

1141
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,399
but I saw Meghan rifling through all the pockets.

1142
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,559
No, no, no, no. My Bath & Body Works coupons!

1143
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,559
Walter. Clay Vanstone, remember?

1144
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,759
- Hey. - How are you?

1145
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,160
- I want to show you Zenotek. - Ah. Yes.

1146
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,639
You're a very expressive dancer.

1147
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,159
Oh, thanks. Let me know if you want me

1148
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,799
to dance, like, sexy or something, you know?

1149
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,660
- Yeah. No, we're good. - Okay.

1150
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:03,079
Uh, hey, there's actually some guys I want you to meet.

1151
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,279
okay, great.

1152
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,359
Let's just work out the money thing first, though, yeah?

1153
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,559
Uh, I already gave Trina $200.

1154
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,159
Oh, yeah, that's just for the first hour.

1155
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,599
If you want me for the rest of the night,

1156
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,119
it's gonna be another $2,000.

1157
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,959
- Two grand? No. No way. - Yeah.

1158
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,359
the website clearly said

1159
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,399
it was $200 for the whole night.

1160
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,279
Do I look like I'm $200 a night?

1161
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,759
Okay, fine. I'll go to an ATM, okay?

1162
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,959
Okay. Give me your watch as collateral.

1163
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,119
It's my grandmother's.

1164
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,279
I don't care.

1165
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,580
Shit.

1166
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,359
Holy shit.

1167
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,340
that was just how daddy likes it.

1168
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,719
Mmm-hmm.

1169
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,159
Check it out.

1170
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,180
you're a fireman.

1171
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,959
Must be really nice to have a day care centre at work.

1172
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,359
Yeah, yeah. Clay set this up when I was pregnant.

1173
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,599
I think he just wanted an excuse

1174
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,959
to have Play-Doh in the office.

1175
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,740
shall we? oh.

1176
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,719
- You are such a good mum. - Aw.

1177
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,140
Thanks.

1178
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,559
I, uh, bet you'd make me finish all my homework

1179
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,519
before I could go outside and play.

1180
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,919
Yeah, especially if you were being naughty.

1181
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,839
Do I need to be punished?

1182
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:21,480
Well, I guess that depends on your homework.

1183
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,319
I bet you'd make me

1184
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,919
brush my teeth so I don't get any cavities.

1185
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,900
oh, we're still doing this. okay.

1186
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,359
I've been a bad boy, Mummy.

1187
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:41,199
Okay, um, do you have some kind of weird fetish?

1188
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,740
What? No!

1189
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,959
No, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to give you

1190
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,999
that impression.

1191
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,759
- I just got carried away. - Oh.

1192
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,959
I just really like you.

1193
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,700
Yeah. I really like you, too.

1194
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,799
Something's happening in my diaper.

1195
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,719
- Okay. Fuck this. I got to go. - Huh?

1196
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,919
- This is my nightmare. - What?

1197
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,959
- So, yes, I'm in hell. - No, uh...

1198
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,599
- So I'm gonna go. - Mummy!

1199
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,959
I mean, Allison. Don't leave.

1200
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,320
Save that shit for the fourth date like a normal person!

1201
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,120
Sorry.

1202
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,180
All right, Nate, this is what you've been saving for.

1203
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,959
Who designed this?

1204
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,440
come on!

1205
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,840
Shit! Fuck me!

1206
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,200
Yes.

1207
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,760
I'm okay! Merry Christmas!

1208
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,600
okay. you ready?

1209
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,360
Okay, you look ridiculous.

1210
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,800
Is it the hat?

1211
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,279
Hey. Merry Christmas, everybody!

1212
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,140
Who's happy about the holidays?

1213
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,780
okay. okay.

1214
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,959
Hey, so, um, you dickheads want to buy some cocaine?

1215
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,999
yeah! we'll do that.

1216
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,100
One cocaine. Want to do it with us?

1217
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,380
Yeah! Yeah!

1218
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,719
I believe in taking risks, Walter.

1219
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,959
Zenotek, my company, believes in taking risks.

1220
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,159
You know what we should do tonight?

1221
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,319
We should do something that scares us.

1222
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,520
Makes us feel alive!

1223
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,959
Do you think you could

1224
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,119
swing across the dance floor with those lights?

1225
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,559
What's that?

1226
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,519
Like, if you grabbed every single strand,

1227
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,639
do you think that you could swing

1228
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,759
and then time it just right and grab all of those strands,

1229
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,959
then, like Tarzan, make it all the way to my office?

1230
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,400

00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,360
- Yeah. - Right?

1407
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,959
- Hey, Jeremy. - Huh?

1408
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:06,959
Hey!

1409
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,959
- Hey, man. - What's up, guys?

1410
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,780
Wow. Good thing I wasn't going number two, huh?

1411
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,559
Yeah. Leave you to it.

1412
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:18,740
- This is my territory! - JOSH: Got it. That's clear.

1413
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,359
they can't shut us down!

1414
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,759
We're never gonna get shut down!

1415
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,119
# when i say zeno, you say tek

1416
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,380
# zeno-tek! zeno-tek!

1417
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,959
# When I say Zeno, you say Tek

1418
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,220
# zeno-tek! zeno-tek!

1419
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,460
It's a Christmas miracle.

1420
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,959
# When I say Zeno, you say Tek

1421
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,220
# zeno-tek! zeno-tek!

1422
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,959
# When I say Zeno, you say Tek

1423
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,340
# zeno-tek! zeno-tek! #

1424
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,920
I love this party!

1425
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,840
I love this company!

1426
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,860
And I want to work with you people!

1427
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:01,119
What did he just say? Did Clay just close Walter?

1428
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,920
Huh, he really is Santa Claus.

1429
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:10,940
yeah!

1430
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,300
(DOOR CLOSES) 

1431
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,119
So, Carol. You know,

1432
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,959
- that's my grandmother's name. - Mmm.

1433
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,599
(INDISTINCT CHATTER) - No, I did not know that. - Yeah.

1434
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,759
Oh.

1435
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,199
It's kind of an old-timey name. Don't really hear

1436
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,340
Carol much anymore.

1437
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,359
it's like... hi, i'm carol.

1438
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,839
I gotta get home before I miss my stories.

1439
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:59,959
Hi, I'm Carol. I heard about Pearl Harbor on the radio.

1440
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:03,660
Hi, I'm Carol. I died in the beginning of Up.

1441
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,420
that movie?

1442
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,959
Sorry, I'm just nervous.

1443
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,600
My first night on the job. On the ol' J.O.B.

1444
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:13,959
- It's your first night? - Yeah.

1445
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:14,999
Driving?

1446
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,359
First night driving the ol' Ubes.

1447
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:20,079
It's a pretty sweet gig, though. Make my own hours.

1448
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,919
You know, I could hook you up

1449
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,719
if you want to be an Uber driver.

1450
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,919
(SCOFFS) I'm good. I already have a job. Thank you very much.

1451
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,279
Yeah, but you could be CEO of your own car!

1452
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,940
I am a CEO.

1453
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,440
Of Uber?

1454
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:35,359
Oh, my God. Is this Undercover Boss?

1455
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,959
(CHUCKLES) Is that a camera?

1456
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,359
Am I on ca... Are you wearing a disguise?

1457
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:41,079
No. This is not Undercover Boss.

1458
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,959
I am not the CEO of Uber.

1459
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,359
I am the CEO of Zenotek. Please just drive.

1460
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,040
no shit. i just dropped off,

1461
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:51,520
like, four people at that party tonight.

1462
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,079
I'm sorry?

1463
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,599
They gave me three stars like a bunch of bitches.

1464
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,159
Excuse me. What did you just say?

1465
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,759
- I said they were bitches. - No, no. What party?

1466
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,959
The party at your office. Everybody's like, Oooh.

1467
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,359
- You son of a bitch, Clay. - Yeah, bunch of bitches!

1468
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,959
can you just...

1469
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,100
can you move? move!

1470
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,000
(EXCLAIMS) 

1471
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,919
(CHUCKLES) The English band, the Optic Monkeys?

1472
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,159
You were supposed to see them with your friend Lindsey,

1473
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,359
you were like, I can't go,

1474
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,559
because you couldn't get a babysitter?

1475
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,959
Did you hack into my emails?

1476
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,799
Get the fuck out of here.

1477
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,999
And never use that British accent again.

1478
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,919
Allison, are you okay?

1479
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,940
No! I'm not okay.

1480
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,159
My ex-husband is dating a stripper,

1481
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,359
Drew is cyberstalking me,

1482
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:40,839
and Fred from accounting

1483
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,079
is like a human fucking AMBER Alert.

1484
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:46,720
(MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) Don't I deserve to date someone who is nice?

1485
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,959
Of course you do.

1486
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,359
Allison, you're an amazing person.

1487
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,959
You basically take care of this whole office.

1488
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:54,959
And you do it every day,

1489
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,959
even though most people don't seem to notice.

1490
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,500
so, yeah,

1491
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,959
you deserve someone nice.

1492
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,260
Baby,

1493
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:05,380
I got your text. Ooh, I missed you.

1494
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,959
Come on, let's dance.

1495
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,100
Just hang in there.

1496
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,700
go, rodney! go, rodney!

1497
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,620
Nate!

1498
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,719
Hey, man. Larry from shipping here

1499
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:28,999
actually has a really great story

1500
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,639
that he wants to tell you.

1501
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,639
I was in the bathroom washing my face,

1502
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,199
and this girl came in, like,

1503
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,919
I'll give you a handy for $40.

1504
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:37,959
And the next thing I knew,

1505
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:41,780
my penis was in her hand and then she starts...

1506
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,759
Okay, Larry, I know how a hand job works.

1507
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,559
I had no idea you guys were together.

1508
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,959
Wait, what are you talking about?

1509
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:51,759
So Becca gave Larry a hand job in the men's room.

1510
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,420
Goddamn it!

1511
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,759
ooh, ooh! i'm going next.

1512
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,319
I'm inspired! I'm going next.

1513
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:03,759
(MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING , INDISTINCT CHATTER) - No, I called it. I called it. - No, no, wait.

1514
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,399
- I'm so happy for you! - MAN: Oh, shit.

1515
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,599
I was about to do my balls!

1516
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:11,319
Hey! What about the 3D printer?

1517
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:12,839
- Yes. Yes! - Yeah?

1518
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:15,820
I'm going first, I'm going first!

1519
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,380
Excuse me. Excuse me!

1520
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,200
Excuse me.

1521
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,839
raise your hands if you're keeping your jobs!

1522
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:08,540
Raise your hands if you're gonna get a bonus!

1523
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,959
excuse me.

1524
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,260
Clay?

1525
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,100
Clay!

1526
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,700
Oh, fuck.

1527
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,500
Hey, sis.

1528
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,319
Hey, hey, hey.

1529
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,959
Carol, before you get mad, listen to what I did.

1530
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,519
I said no party!

1531
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,999
That's all I said. All you had to do was nothing,

1532
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,359
and you couldn't even do that! Couldn't even do that!

1533
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,159
Carol, Carol, Carol!

1534
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,399
(MARY EXCLAIMING) This is not what you think, okay?

1535
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,900
This is all for a reason.

1536
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:34,319
Listen. We threw this party for Walter Davis,

1537
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,719
and we closed him, he wants to give us his business.

1538
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:37,959
- We did it. - CLAY: See?

1539
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,959
I'm not a failure. I'm a good boss. The party worked!

1540
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,759
(BLOWER WHIRRING) - Walter Davis? - Yeah.

1541
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,559
- Is at this party? - JOSH: That's right.

1542
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,999
Where is he?

1543
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,639
I don't know. Where was he? He was just on the stage.

1544
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,660
Oh... Guys? Guys!

1545
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,920
That's not good.

1546
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,279
(CLAY SUCKING TEETH) Here we go!

1547
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,959
do it! do it! do it!

1548
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,920
(CLAY GURGLING) No, no, no. Shh!

1549
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,759
- What are you doing? - Hey, that was my idea.

1550
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,959
- Not relevant. - Walter? Hey, buddy!

1551
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,079
(SPITS) Why don't you come down using the stairs?

1552
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:08,359
No. Clay, it's like you said!

1553
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:11,079
I want to do something that scares me. To feel

1554
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,440
alive!

1555
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:13,959
Maybe not right now.

1556
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:15,919
(EXHALES DEEPLY) What did you guys do to him?

1557
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,719
Let go of those lines, buddy!

1558
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:20,400
I'm the king of I.T. buyers!

1559
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:23,260
Whoo!

1560
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,160
- Oh! - CAROL: Shit!

1561
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,500
Oh!

1562
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,000
Oh, God.

1563
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,500
so close.

1564
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:39,959
Hey, Walter.

1565
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,079
You were like an eagle up there.

1566
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,959
You were free. You did it.

1567
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,359
(INHALES DEEPLY) Did we win?

1568
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:46,119
Yeah, we won.

1569
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,140
zenotek! zenotek!

1570
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:49,959
That poor guy.

1571
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,079
What a day he's had.

1572
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,959
First he gets fired and now this.

1573
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,959
- Wait, what? - Did you say fired?

1574
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,079
Oh, yeah.

1575
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,959
Oh, he got fired at the close of business today.

1576
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,319
He told me, like, two hours ago.

1577
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,959
They shipped his whole branch overseas.

1578
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:01,959
What?

1579
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,839
I confirmed it with my H.R. Facebook group.

1580
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:05,519
And they know everything.

1581
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,399
Excuse me. Just to clarify, because I'm detail-oriented.

1582
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,559
So you didn't get a contract with Walter Davis

1583
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,959
because he didn't have a contract to give.

1584
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,519
Carol, before you get mad, here's the thing...

1585
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,719
He wanted to work with us.

1586
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:17,839
- So... - Clay. Clay!

1587
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,140
Yeah?

1588
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,919
I'm not mad.

1589
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:21,959
You're not?

1590
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:24,959
I mean, I was mad when Dad gave you this branch

1591
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,959
just as a reward for taking six years

1592
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,540
to graduate with a degree in... What is it?

1593
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,799
Canadian television theory with concentration in Drake.

1594
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,759
but this doesn't make me mad.

1595
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,639
- I feel relieved. - All right.

1596
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,720
because it's over.

1597
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,279
(SNIFFLES) - I'm shutting you down. - Yeah, no, because it's late.

1598
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:43,559
Allison got a clean-up crew

1599
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,719
- for tomorrow. - CAROL: Uh-huh.

1600
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,959
No, Clay. I'm terminating this branch.

1601
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,359
(SNIFFLES) I'm such a dickhead. I started to like this place,

1602
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:52,559
and then I get fucked. I get fucked!

1603
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,959
No, no, no. Stop it, stop it. Carol, let's take one beat.

1604
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:55,959
Look, look, Carol. Carol.

1605
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,199
I fucked up, okay, so blame me.

1606
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,839
But these are good people.

1607
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,959
You can't close this branch. This is Dad's branch.

1608
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:01,959
Well, you know what? He shouldn't have

1609
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:04,580
(BREATHES DEEPLY) given it to you to fuck up.

1610
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:08,560
Oh, and, uh, good luck trying to be Mr Fun Guy

1611
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,719
when you have to fire all these people.

1612
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:11,839
whoo!

1613
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,279
I'll see you in New York.

1614
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:14,399
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) Wait, what?

1615
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,959
Did your little friend not tell you?

1616
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:16,959
He's coming to work for me.

1617
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,159
Yeah, right.

1618
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,399
I never said yes to that job.

1619
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:22,440
I don't recall you ever saying no.

1620
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,359
Clay.

1621
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,800
Clay, I never sa... Hey.

1622
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,260
Clay.

1623
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:39,519
Oh, hey, Clay... You told me you had a two-drink limit.

1624
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,559
Yeah. You're right.

1625
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:44,839
Now, y'all didn't forget about DJ Calvis!

1626
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,140
whoo!

1627
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,639
i want to go back to the party!

1628
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,940
Whoo!

1629
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,959
Hey! What the hell?

1630
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,559
I hired you to pretend to be my girlfriend,

1631
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,839
then you go and give all my co-workers hand jobs?

1632
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,959
You hired me to impress your co-workers,

1633
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,199
and he was pretty impressed.

1634
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,799
(SCATTERED CHEERS) - Listen, I want my money back. - Well...

1635
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,599
I'm sorry, what was that?

1636
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,919
I couldn't hear you over my gun.

1637
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,799
- I, um, I want my money back. - Oh.

1638
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:21,759
I'm sorry. Customer services are not available right now,

1639
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,959
but perhaps I can address your grievance.

1640
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,280
um, everything's fine.

1641
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,999
Would you say like a five on Yelp,

1642
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,959
(GRUNTING) or like positive three?

1643
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,079
Five.

1644
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,860
Five? Alexei!

1645
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:34,940
uh...

1646
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:36,839
This is so funny.

1647

Do that thing where you pull his asshole through his face.

1648
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:40,959
Don't please. Shit!

1649
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,719
Santa's gonna get fucked up tonight!

1650
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,999
who wants to party with santa?

1651
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,639
(CROWD GASPS , LAUGHING) Who the fuck is that?

1652
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,279
you know what, that guy is really rich.

1653
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:50,959
And he's really stupid.

1654
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,839
Well, then what are we doing with Spelling Bee here?

1655
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,980
Get outta here. Go!

1656
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,560
Hey, Santa! Wanna party?

1657
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:01,940
Yeah.

Tracey!

hey!

Tracey?

01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,400
Tracey, are you in here?

1663
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,519
Oh, pardon me.

1664
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,839
Hello?

Oh.

josh, it's happening.

1667
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,740
Good for you.

1668
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,560
Hey, Tracey, which one are you in?

1669
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:29,959
Hi. Carol offered me a job, but in no way did I say...

1670
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,759
Josh. I get it.

1671
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,959
She offered me a job, too.

1672
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:35,799
- What? She offered you a job? - Yeah.

1673
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:36,959
Triple the salary.

1674
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,999
An apartment overlooking Central Park.

1675
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,119
I got double and moving costs.

1676
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,399
the real difference is i said no.

1677
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:44,959
Listen, I'm not fighting with you about this.

1678
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,199
It's silly. I didn't take the job.

1679
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,599
Yeah. But you didn't not take it, either.

1680
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:51,159
Because you need a safety net. Hey, that's who you are.

1681
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:54,759
I'm happy for you. You should go to New York.

1682
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,559
Is that what you want? You want me to go to New York?

1683
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,639
There's a real human centipede situation

1684
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:00,959
happening in the men's room.

1685
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,999
Tracey, please. Don't go.

1686
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,919
Whoa, this is almost the whole marketing department in here.

1687
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,959
- Can I get a drink? - ALAN: Josh, Josh.

1688
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,399
Josh, where's Clay?

1689
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,079
Asswipe loses everybody their jobs and runs.

1690
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:14,799
How much did he spend on this party?

1691
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:15,959
He could have just given that money to us.

1692
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,199
Clay sucks.

1693
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,559
We should just kill him, like on that podcast.

1694
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:19,959
Put the Red Bull down.

1695
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:21,959
Respectfully, fuck you guys!

1696
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,839
Sorry, that was too much, but...

1697
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,959
Clay cares more about people

1698
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,639
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS , MAN SHOUTS) than anyone I've ever met.

1699
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,279
He was gonna pay your bonuses tonight

1700
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,519
with the last of his money.

1701
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,759
What?

1702
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,279
Yeah, he's broke. Clay is broke.

1703
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,519
Who do you think paid

1704
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:36,319
for that bouncy house in accounting?

1705
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,719
Training that dog to deliver the mail?

1706
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,279
The zip-line? Doughnut Fridays?

1707
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,799
It was all Clay!

1708
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,079
(JOEL CONTINUES YELLING) He spent all of his money

1709
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,959
trying to keep this branch afloat.

1710
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,279
And whenever I questioned him about it, he would say,

1711
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:50,559
Treat your employees like they're your family

1712
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,719
and they'll do great things for you.

1713
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,079
You guys, Clay just left to get drugs

1714
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,359
with Becca and her pimp.

1715
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,719
Wait... Who's Becca?

1716
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,799
- Nate's whore. - Hey, that's his girlfriend!

1717
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,759
Nope, she's right.

1718
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,359
Becca's a prostitute.

1719
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,900
oh, nice.

1720
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:04,959
Oh. Nope.

1721
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,799
Clay left to go get drugs with a pimp?

1722
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,279
Yes. She has a gun and a serious mood imbalance.

1723
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,599
Fuck. Carol!

1724
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:11,799
We have a problem.

1725
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:13,959
Yeah, you have lots of problems. Good luck.

1726
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,980
Carol, excuse me.

1727
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:17,959
Carol! Listen.

Clay has gone to get wasted with a psychopath,

1729
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,919
and he's got $300,000 strapped to his chest.

1730
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:25,519
Ooh, that really does sound like a big problem...

1731
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:26,719
For Clay.

1732
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:27,839
You already lost your dad.

1733
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,719
If you lose Clay, you'll have no one.

1734
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:33,279
Trust me, that's not a place you want to be.

1735
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,599
- I don't care. - TRACEY: What?

1736
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,600
- Oh, boy. This woman... - What is wrong with her?

1737
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,279
Really?

1740

I think I can locate him.

(INDISTINCT) This is so amazing to me, guys.

1742

We can actually connect with, you know.

1743
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:51,959
Yeah. Yeah. There we go.

1744
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,159
- Amazing. - Absolutely.

They're full of shit, okay? They're not your soulmates.

1746

Okay, I'm gonna need both of you assclowns

1751
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,319
to hack into Clay's phone so we can find him.

1752

01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,420
# Was born on Christmas Day

1924
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:20,740
# To save us all from Satan's power

1925
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,400

# Comfort and joy! #

1930
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,759
- Oh, God. - Yeah, I fucked up. I did.

1931
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:03,959
I lost a lot of people's jobs.

1932
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,959
I hurt a lot of good people tonight.

1933
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:07,519
Oh, yeah, totally. Cool story.

1934
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:08,799
Are we coming up to your apartment building

1935
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,199
on the left, to the right, or...

1936
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:11,559
We're not going to my apartment.

1937
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:12,839
Uh, yes, we are.

1938
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,639
(WHIMPERS) We are going to your apartment to go to the safe.

1939
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,959
There's nothing safe about what we're gonna do.

1940
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,359
Yeah, it's like you said, you know.

1941
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,959
We need to escape them, so that's what we're gonna do.

1942
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,759
- Red light. - TRINA: What the fuck

1943
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:23,959
are you talking about? There's a red light!

1944
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,100
That's a red light!

1945
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,140
oh, yeah!

1946
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:33,840
We go right through 'em. They're just suggestions.

1947
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,700
(NATE WHIMPERS) 

1948
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:37,199
- Can you look at that fuck? - Oh, the fucking windshield.

1949
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,399
(SNIFFLES) Are you kidding? Not now!

1950
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,599
That's the A.C., Josh. We don't need that right now.

1951
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:41,759
What about that?

1952
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:42,959
Oh. No, that's the recirculating mode.

1953
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,959
How am I gonna run Zenotek without this Genius Bar?

1954
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,159
You can get up here and help if you'd like.

1955
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,839
Okay, my seat's getting hotter.

1956
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:49,959
Mary, why do you even have a minivan?

1957
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:52,559
- You don't have kids. - I buy in bulk!

1958
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:53,799
- TRACEY: Oh! It's them! - Yeah.

1959
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,079
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, good eyes.

1960
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,959
Oh, God! What's that smell?

1961
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,159
I'm gonna be honest with you,

1962
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:01,380
I have been farting this entire time.

1963
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,079
oh, my gosh.

1964
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,279
Okay, you know what,

1965
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:08,159
take me to your personal safe right now.

1966
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,719
We don't need money where we're going.

1967
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:10,959
- Where are we going? - For glory.

1968
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,279
The Clark Street Bridge.

1969
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:13,639
This time of night it'll be up.

1970
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:17,520
We're gonna jump the bridge and never look back.

1971
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:24,319
Okay, new game. Pull over.

1972
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:25,559
Just pull over or I'll tuck and roll.

1973
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:26,959
- No, no, no. Trina, Trina. - Just slow down.

1974
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,799
Trina, I've been thinking about this for a while.

1975
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:29,959
We can make this jump.

1976
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:30,959
(CHEERY MUSIC PLAYING) I let a lot of people down,

1977
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,599
but I'm not gonna let you guys down.

1978
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,159
We're gonna escape our families and become anew!

1979
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:36,519
Pull over right now.

1980
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:38,279
Or I shoot you in the fucking brain.

1981
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:39,719
Well, you can't shoot him,

1982
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:41,519
because then he's gonna crash the car.

1983
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,799
Really, Savannah? Really?

1984
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:44,959
Why don't you put it in an email

1985
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:46,119
and c.c. everyone, all right?

1986
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:48,599
Make double sure everyone got it.

1987
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,919
You know what, you should start a podcast, Savannah,

1988
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:55,040
called Savannah Says Fucking Stupid Things Out Loud.

1991
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:04,319
I was never gonna take that job.

1992
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,639
Not good enough!

1993
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,279
Do not jump that bridge.

1994
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:11,100
I have to do this. Carol's right, I'm a fuckup!

1995
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:12,660
Shit!

1996
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:20,820
Pull over, you fucking idiot!

1997
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,719
Or, the nice supportive version?

1998
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:26,199
Pull over, fucking idiot!

1999
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,380
No.

2000
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,279
Hey, tell him to pull over, lady!

2001
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:33,580
Look. Pull over! Pull over! Pull over! It doesn't work!

2002
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:36,599
- It's not working. - None of it works!

2003
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:37,959
Hey, Clay,

2004
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:40,919
you jump that bridge, I'm going with you.

2005
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:42,159
What? No!

2006
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,519
yes, i am.

2007
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:46,639
Did you say hit it at 80 or 90, Vin Diesel?

2008
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:49,680
- Put it into sport. - Here we go.

2009
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,919
Josh, I'm sorry that I said you were safe.

2010
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,959
- You don't have to do this. - Yes, I do.

2011
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:57,959
Josh, what are you doing, man?

2012
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,040
You go, we all go!

2013
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,260
Fuck.

2014
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:04,740
I love America!

2015
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,920
I am not gonna die in a minivan.

2016
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:16,180
Hey, hey, hey! Get off the wheel!

2017

(TRACEY TALKING INDISTINCTLY) 

2019
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:03,420
We could've made that bridge, panty hose.

2020
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,100
Where's Clay?

2021
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:15,640
It was on your person.

2022
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:23,880
What did we hit?

2023
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:26,079
The collision severed the primary fibre line,

2024
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:27,839
as well as its backup,

2025
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,839
paralyzing Internet, DSL,

2026
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,199
and cellular communications citywide.

2027
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,519
So if you haven't ordered your holiday gifts early,

2028
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:36,959
you may not be able to order them at all.

2029
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,999
I quit, by the way!

2030
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,639
You quit what? What, Savannah? What'd you quit?

2031
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:43,519
Just a couple of normal girls here.

2032
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:45,119
move it, move it! clear!

2033
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,959

2034
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:48,559
My brother needs a doctor!

2035
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:49,959
Ma'am, you're gonna need to wait your turn.

2036
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,759
Will you find someone that will help my brother?

2037
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:54,199
All of you, just back up!

2038
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:57,559
Back up. Make a single file line against that wall

2039
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:01,860
and she will be with you when she has a fucking minute!

2040
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:12,799
You know, you trying to jump that bridge was really...

2041
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,959
Brave? That what you were going for?

2042
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:17,799
No. Stupid. I was gonna say stupid.

2043
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,839
No. I... I would say brave.

2044
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,959
- A little brave. - Yeah. Hi.

2045
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:23,999
- Hey, how is he? - Oh. He's fine.

2046
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,959
In fact, the doctor said that the crash

2047
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:28,959
actually fixed a previous fracture.

2048
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,919
He's got... He's got this gift.

2049
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:32,359
I don't... I don't get it.

2050
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:34,959
(CHANTING) - Oh. Thank God he's okay. - Oh, well...

2051
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:37,399
So, maybe you'll reconsider firing everyone?

2052
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,919
Once it gets out there that we caused this crash,

2053
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,319
the board finds out,

2054
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:43,759
my ass is fired. No one has a job.

2055
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,720
- So... - Carol?

2056
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,359
Is now a good time to exchange insurance information

2057
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:49,839
for the car stuff?

2058
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:52,839
It's not. You know, we would've made it, by the way.

2059
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:55,079
- At the speed you were going? - Comfortably.

2060
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:57,199
Please. To make that jump, with that incline,

2061
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,359
you would have had to at least been going...

2062
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:01,080
- 110. - 95.

2063
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,980
(ALL CHEERING) No, 95.

2064
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:07,399
- It's simple math. - Oh. Well, okay.

2065
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,359
It might be simple on paper,

2066
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:12,959
but you're forgetting the wind, the weight of the Kia,

2067
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,860
the four of us,

2068
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:16,599
bird cages...

2069
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:20,159
I prefer to call them bird condos, and so do the birds.

2070
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:22,839
Point being, you have to adjust your numbers

2071
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:25,759
to account for real world conditions.

2072
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:29,159
Simple. Or did they not teach you that in hacker college?

2073
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:30,399
(LAUGHING) You're right.

2074
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:31,999
Thank you.

2075
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,399
No, not about that.

2076
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:35,959
Although hacker college does sound awesome.

2077
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:39,300
It's AnywAir. I've been doing it wrong.

2078
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,959
I... I've been treating the power grid

2079
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,959
as if it was a seamless source of Internet.

2080
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:48,120
It's not seamless, it's messy. It...

2081
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:50,959
But if there was an opportunity

2082
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:53,719
where the conditions were just right.

2083
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:57,159
If we were inside of a vacuum. If it was still.

2084
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:58,820
Oh, my God.

2085
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:01,119
- An Internet blackout. - An Internet blackout!

2086
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,279
Let's get you back to the office.

2087
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:03,959
- Yes! - Come on.

2088
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:07,480
I'm gonna text you that claims form, yeah?

2089
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:18,780
- I'm sorry, Mary. - MARY: Go save the company!

2090
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:45,200
Mum?

2091
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,200

01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:18,400
Hey.

2096
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:23,119
Carla!

2097
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:24,599
(CONTINUES SINGING IN GERMAN) - Wassup? - Morning.

2098
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:27,359
I tased as many as I could, but...

2099
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:29,959
Yeah. Well, I actually thought it was gonna be worse, so...

2100
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:31,079
Uh-uh!

2101
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:33,959
I see you, bitch! Uh-uh, bitch, I see you!

2102
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:35,639
Your office was locked, right?

2103
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:37,079
Yeah, of course.

2104
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:41,260
- What... What's happening? - Did you guys find Clay?

2105
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,079
- Sorry. Old habit. - Sure.

2106
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:53,599
Okay. So, what... You're writing an algorithm

2107
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,839
that can respond to the grid in real time?

2108
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,640
- That's gonna take... - Done.

2109
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:00,159
Forever.

2110
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:02,839
Nate! How's that server bank?

2111
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:04,959
Still covered in beer! Five minutes!

2112
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,980
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) I hope it's beer.

2113
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:09,119
Hey.

2114
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:10,559
Uh, about what happened...

2115
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:11,959
All good. Everyone has their thing.

2116
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:14,159
I know it seems weird, but I just crave discipline.

2117
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:15,959
My family had no set meal times.

2118
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:18,319
Yeah, it's cool. I don't need your origin story.

2119
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,799
Promise me you won't tell anyone?

2120
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,759
- I'll do your taxes! - Deal.

2121
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:23,959
Great.

2122
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:27,159
Oh, my God, the office. Hey, guys, I got doughnuts!

2123
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:30,320
I got, uh, jelly and glazed and, uh,

2124
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:31,959
some other stuff. But no Cronuts,

2125
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:34,400
that's a bastard pastry.

2126
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:39,400
I still hate your rules.

2127
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,700
But your dancing is

2128
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:43,799
wild and free.

2129
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:46,420
Like an unmanned fire hose.

2130
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:50,040
Put your pants on.

2131
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:54,400
For now.

2132
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:57,839
Now, we can't fix the Internet

2133
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:58,959
if we can't get on the Internet.

2134
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,399
Everything is down.

2135
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:01,799
Okay, well, all the phones are working.

2136
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:02,959
What about a dial-up modem?

2137
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,399
Great. Now all you need is a RadioShack

2138
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:05,639
and a time machine.

2139
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:08,319
- Oh, the G1 had it, right? - There's one in Clay's office.

2140
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,519
I got the desk. Get the desk.

2141
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,959
Okay, give me the wires. Plug it in here. Give me that.

2142
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:14,159
Hey, I could use some of that giddy-up in H.R.

2143
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:15,999
if you two ponies are looking for a new stable.

2144
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,199
I am looking for a new stable, Mary.

2145
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:18,559
Thank you so much. We'll talk later.

2146
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,719
Mary, you're showing a lot of neck.

2147
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:20,959
Breaking your own rules.

2148
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:22,959
It's a little skanky, isn't it?

2149
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:24,559
- Plug it in. - NATE: Plugged in.

2150
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:26,079
Uh, I got this D.J. equipment,

2151
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,319
if you want to use that for something.

2152
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:29,359
Okay, that's not gonna help, but thank you.

2153
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:31,119
All right, guys.

2154
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:32,359
(STAMMERING) What now?

2155
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:34,839
I press Enter, it launches the protocol, and then...

2156
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,199
And then everybody gets back on the Internet.

2157
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:37,519
Hopefully.

2158
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,159
Or I blow up the power grid.

2159
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,279
- So be ready for that. - Okay?

2160
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,799
Don't worry about that. Just hit Enter.

2161
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:45,460
Okay, guys.

2162
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:47,460
Here we go.

2163
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:57,639
Power's still on.

2164
01:32:57,640 --> 01:32:59,399
Yeah, I'm honestly shocked by that.

2165
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:00,839
No Internet yet, though.

2166
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:01,959
It could take a few seconds.

2167
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:04,159
If it works, you'll have a connection alert.

2168
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:06,079
- No. - No, nothing.

2169
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,800
nothing yet.

2170
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:11,079
- No? Anybody? - No.

2171
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:12,319
no, nothing.

2172
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,559
Josh?

2173
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:16,720
No. Just give it a little more time.

2174
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:18,140
(EXHALES) 

2175
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:19,319
Maybe it wasn't ready.

2176
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:21,040
Tracey, hey.

2177
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:23,060
It's ready.

2178
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:26,500
still dead. waiting for it. still dead.

2179
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:31,920
(BOTH LAUGH) 

2180
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:33,079
- Is that you? - Got it.

2181
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:34,559
- Got it! - Oh, my God.

2182
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,719
- Yep, I got it. - Oh, my God!

2183
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:38,079
- Was that you? - I got it!

2184
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,559
yeah, i got it, too!

2185
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:42,839
I got mine! Yeah. Yeah, there's mine. Holy shit!

2186
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:45,220
- Tracey! - You did it!

2187
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,400
(CHUCKLES) 

2188
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:09,559
Work never stops. You see that?

2189
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:11,820
Excuse me. Excuse me.

2190
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:14,399
Hello, yes. I am happy for you, but I do need you to

2191
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:16,639
sign a personal relationship disclosure form

2192
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:17,839
before this rounds first.

2193
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:19,639
No. No, I don't think so.

2194
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:21,900
Hey, Mary, sign this.

2195
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:25,559
Oh. Oh, you know what? Um, I really like you,

2196
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:27,759
um, but maybe we could get, like, a cup of coffee first,

2197
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:28,959
or something?

2198
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:30,800
Yeah! Totally.

2199
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:33,639
That's what I meant by, Sign this.

2200
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:36,740
- You know what? Forget it. - Okay.

glass of wine in a family photo?

2202
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:51,079
Look at him in that suit. What a stud.

2203
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:53,279
He wore that better than you.

2204
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:55,959
Yeah, he did a lot of things better than me.

2205
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:57,839
You're right to be pissed at me.

2206
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,279
You know, I always got to do whatever I wanted

2207
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:00,519
(CHUCKLES) and you always ended up

2208
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:01,839
with the shit end of the stick.

2209
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,740
It wasn't fair.

2210
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,460
I'm sorry, sis.

2211
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:08,980
Thank you for that.

2212
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,959
You never got to be the fun one, huh?

2213
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:13,799
- I mean, I could have. Right? - Yeah.

2214
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,199
- Sure. - I have... I have a fun side.

2215
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,639
I've seen it many a time.

2216
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:18,959
I mean...

2217
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:20,959
Off the top of my head, I...

2218
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:22,959
Remember that Thanksgiving that you taught everybody

2219
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:24,959
the real rules of Monopoly?

2220
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:27,119
With the bidding wars and the strict time limit and...

2221
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:29,559
- Yeah, that wasn't fun. - I know.

2222
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:32,720
Hi! My pain is at a 9 or a 10 or 11.

2223

Whatever on the chart, the...

That face?

2225
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:37,719
So can I get some Dilaudid

2226
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:39,759
in another one of those little gelatine cups?

2227
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:42,920
You can't buy those. I looked it up.

2228
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:47,440
Huh. The Internet's back up.

2229
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:50,119

Oh, my God! She did it. She did it!

01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,919
- Shut the fuck door! - Oh.

(BOTH MOANING) I gotta tell you, I was always like,

2234

Tracey, this doesn't make any sense,

2235
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,279
and she was like, Words, words, words

2236
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:05,759
and some numbers. But she did it.

2237
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:06,959
Oh, my God.

2238
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:08,639
Wait. So, this means everybody gets to keep their jobs?

2239
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:09,839
Everybody gets to keep their jobs.

2240
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:10,999
Yes!

And you throw a great fucking party.

2244
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:20,520
Yeah. I did, didn't I?

2245
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:23,780
- Oh! Walter. - Walter.

(MUTTERING) Well, he'll fit right in.

Wow.

did you see that?

01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:52,580
oh.

what are you doing? winner!

- We weren't racing. - Well, you weren't.

01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:55,799
It's a hard word to say.

2345
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:59,860
To keep this branch afloat with his in-her-i-tance.

2353
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:36,759
because I wanted to take a month off from work.

2354
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:39,200
And I kissed him deeply.

2355
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,080
